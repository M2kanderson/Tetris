**The classic Tetris game redone in JavaScript and jQuery!**

Check out the live version [here](https://m2kanderson.github.io/).

Tetris is a classic tile-matching puzzle video game. Tetriminos fall from the sky and it is your job to match the variously shaped 4-block pieces so that they form a 10 block horizontal line.  Each time this occurs, your score goes up and thoses lines vanish.  Don't let the blocks hit the top though, or it's game over.

## How to Play

Click the start button to begin the game.  Tetriminos will begin to fall from the top.  Tetriminos can be rotated using the up arrow ![Up Arrow] or moved left or right using the arrow keys ![Left Arrow] ![Right Arrow]. The down arrow ![Down Arrow]
will move the Tetrimino quickly to the bottom. As you gain points, the fall speed of the Tetrimino will increase.  Good luck!
